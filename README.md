This repository is highly experimental. It's an archive of old experiments and their results.

In short, I'm limiting R2 functions (e.g. f(x,y) = xy) inside a square then tallying their most significant digits.

As the project progresses, I'll explain more about what I'm doing and what I've found out as a result.
